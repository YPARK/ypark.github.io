There are several biological mechanisms. See Four ways alcohol can cause cancer.\nAll of them remind me of cancer biology courses I took a decade ago. I agree alcohol can cause cancer in some ways, but proving the causality and measuring causal effect sizes will probably be another research question. Showing tobacco causes cancer took nearly a half-century from the earliest wakeup calls until the US Surgeon General finally acknowledged the fact, and perhaps longer until the tobacco companies took meaningful action.\nI am wondering if there are any (genetic) instrumental variables to establish some sense of causality. Well... In fact, there are some:\n\n\nGenetic architecture of alcohol consumption identified by a genotype-stratified GWAS and impact on esophageal cancer risk in Japanese people\n\nNo wonder several alcohol intake GWAS variants are located in biochemically-relevant genes, including ALDH1B and ALDH2; they are also \"colocalized\" in interaction analysis with cancer GWAS studies.\n\n\n\nBeyond GWAS of Colorectal Cancer: Evidence of Interaction with Alcohol Consumption and Putative Causal Variant for the 10q24.2 Region\n\n\n\"Another possibility is that light-to-moderate drinking has a protective effect on risk of colorectal cancer, even though heavier consumption is detrimental.\" This clearly sets their questions and why they designed the study to show in which direction effects could go.\n\n\nAlso, G x E interaction analysis with stratification--non-drinking, light-drinking, and heavy-drinking. We see some significant hits (why?), and they end up with somewhat bizarre conclusion: \"Our study suggests that the association with colorectal cancer in 10q24.2/COX15 observed in genome-wide association study is strongest in nondrinkers.\" What about the other variants?\n\n\nWhat if drinking behaviour is a mediator variable (genetic variant to drinking to cancer)? The stratification step could create artificial associations between genetic variants and cancer phenotypes.\n\n\n\n\nThe causal effects of genetically predicted alcohol consumption on endometrial cancer risk from a Mendelian randomization study\n\n\nSummary-based MR analysis.\n\n\nAlso, a bit weird conclusion: \"This MR study suggests that genetically predicted alcohol consumption is a protective factor for EC, particularly for EEC, and this protective effect may be mediated through the reduction of HCG and IGF1.\"\n\n\nWhat if people abstained from drinking because of health concerns, such as a family history of endometrial cancer? IV assumptions would be easily invalid. EC GWAS is also sampled from the same UK Biobank cohorts, which could put the study design in a precarious position.\n\n\n\n\nOkay, I may want to believe that alcohol is a cause of cancer. But I don't think we have a definitive answer to the underlying causal questions. Studies often disagree with each other. It's like opening up another decade of debate among researchers, policymakers, and the general public. However, I don't think we are missing a chance to potential protective effects of alcohol by not cutting down on drinking. A more constructive way forward will be looping in molecular mechanisms in causal inference exercises. We identified the mechanisms in laboratory settings. How does it work at a population level? Are there alcohol-interaction molecular QTL studies? Shouldn't we consider gene-gene interactions and compensatory mechanisms?

One of the primary goals is to identify cell types (clusters/factors) and cell-type-specific gene expression patterns. However, distinguishing batch-specific and cell-type-specific genes only by a factorization method is challenging and often not identifiable from data alone. For each gene $g$ and cell $j$, the gene expression $Y_{gj}$ were sampled from Poisson distribution with the rate parameter:\n$$\\lambda_{gj} = \\lambda_{gj}^{\\textsf{unbiased}} \\times \\prod_{k} \\delta_{gk}^{X_{kj}},$$\naffected by the batch effects $\\delta_{gk}$. More formally, letting $X_{kj}$ be a batch membership matrix, assigning a cell $j$ to a batch $k$ if and only if $X_{kj}=1$, we assume the average gene expression rates are linearly affected by in the log-transformed space:\n$$\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\ln Y_{gj}\\right] = \\ln \\left( \\sum_{t} \\beta_{gt} \\theta_{jt} \\right) + \\sum_{k} \\ln\\delta_{gk} X_{kj}.$$\n\nIf we can accurately estimate a true batch effect matrix, say $\\delta_{gk}$, it is straightforward to adjust the difference between batches. How can we identify the true batch effect $\\delta_{gk}$ for all the genes $g$ specifically expressed in the batch $k$? If we match cells $i$ and $j$ sampled from the batches $a$ and $b$, respectively, we expect the batch-specific difference $\\delta_{ga} \\neq \\delta_{gk}$ will persist and even amplify, but the difference originated from cell types will vanish. This problem is equivalent to estimating the potential outcome of gene expressions in each batch $k$, $\\mathbb{E}\\left[Y_{gj}^{(k)}\\right]$.\nA causal inference approach to identify batch effects\nTo dissect batch-specific effect in a causal inference (potential outcome) framework, we assume our confounding variables $Q$ are well-distributed across different batches:\n\nOverlap: $0 &lt; p(X_{kj}=1|Q) &lt; 1$ for all $k$.\n\nMoreover, we assume these covariates are sufficient enough to induce conditional dependence between potential (imputed) gene expression and batch assignment mechanisms:\n\nStrong ignorability: $(Y(k), Y(k')) \\perp\\perp X | Q$ for all $k,k'$ pairs.\n\nEstimation of the batch effects by matching\nSuppose we can counterfactually estimate gene expressions of a certain cell $j$ if the cell was measured in different batches other than the observed batch $k$.\n$$Z_{gj} = \\frac{ \\sum_{i} (1 - X_{ik}) w_{ji} Y_{gi} }{ \\sum_{i} (1 - X_{ik}) w_{ji} }$$\nLike many other batch correction methods invented for single-cell RNA-seq analysis, we will assume $Z_{gj}$ reliably contain biologically-relevant cell state information while excluding the batch-specific effects to which the cell $j$ belong.\nObserved log-likelihood:\n$$\\prod_{j} p(Y_{gj}|\\mu_{gs},\\delta_{gk},X_{jk})\n=\\prod_{j} \\operatorname{Poisson}(Y_{gj}|\\mu_{gs} \\sum_{k} \\delta_{gk} X_{jk})$$\nCounterfactual log-likelihood:\n$$\\prod_{j} p(Z_{gj}|\\mu_{gs}, \\gamma_{gs}) = \\prod_{j} \\operatorname{Poisson}(Z_{gj}|\\mu_{gs} \\gamma_{gs})$$\nLocal update: Maximize batch $s$-specific parameters\nLet's update $\\mu_{gs}$ for a gene $g$ in a sample $s$:\n$$\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\mu_{gs}\\right] \\approx \\frac{ \\sum_{j \\in C_{s}} Y_{gj} + \\sum_{j \\in C_{s}} Z_{gj} }{\\sum_{k} \\delta_{gk} n_{sk} + n_{s} \\gamma_{gs}}$$\nLetting $p_{sk} = n_{sk} / n_{s}$,\n$$\\mu_{gs} \\gets \\frac{ Y_{gs} + Z_{gs}}{\\sum_{k} \\delta_{gk} p_{sk} + \\gamma_{gs}}$$\nIf $\\delta_{gk} \\to 0$ and $p_{sk}=1$, meaning that this sample $s$ is just sampled from the batch $k$ only,\n$\\mu_{gs} \\to Y_{gs} + Z_{gs}$ and\n$Y_{gs} \\to Y_{gsk} = 0$.\nTherefore, $\\mu_{gs} \\to Z_{gs}$.\nGlobal update\n$$\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\delta_{gk}\\right] \\approx \\frac{\\sum_{s} \\sum_{j \\in C_{s}} X_{kj} Y_{gj}}{\\sum_{s} \\mu_{gs} \\sum_{j \\in C_{s}} X_{kj}}$$\n$$\\delta_{gk} \\gets \\frac{\\sum_{s} Y_{gsk} n_{sk}}{\\sum_{s} \\mu_{gs} n_{sk}}$$\nIf $Y_{gsk} \\to \\mu_{gs}$ for all $s$, $\\delta_{gk} \\to 1$.

We reinvent traditional bioinformatics methods to ascertain the causality of discoveries made in high-dimensional omics data.\n\nMassive data generation in genomics has transformed the methodology and practice of researches in medicine and human biology. A common practice of research is genomic and functional genomic profiling of hundreds of individuals. If desired data is not available, large consortium-level projects and collaborations can often meet the needs. In terms of both volume and dimensionality, the sizes of genomics data have exploded in the past decade, and it is not hard to predict that the speed of data accumulation will be further accelerated.\nGenomics has made a breakthrough in medicine and science, armed with two powerful scientific methods--hypothesis testing and machine learning (ML). Hypothesis testing with well-designed null distributions proves meaningful scientific discoveries are made on the observed data. Likewise, a traditional ML method is designed to efficiently search the most plausible models from a particular class of models, mainly focusing on minimizing generalization errors on the observed data.  However, biology's ultimate question is perhaps more about unobserved principles, asking counterfactual \"what if\" questions, rather than simply describing phenomena. We desire to uncover causal mechanisms and laws underlying observations and ultimately provide testable cause-effect relationships.\nCausal inference based on a causal structure model\nMost causal inference concepts based on a structural equation model are already adopted in a carefully designed biological experiment. We can trace back to Sewall Wright's path diagram model. For instance, an experimental proof demonstrating the effect of a gene \"X\" to some trait \"Y\" would require two types of interventions that disruption of the gene X makes changes to the trait Y, and recovery of the gene can attenuate the disrupted functions.  However, a common practice of high-throughput data analysis often lack such intervention steps, but hurriedly arrive at some conclusion based on observed correlation patterns.  Many of these correlations may turn out non-causal but somewhat confounded by unobserved variables.\nIdentification of causal effects by an instrumental variable (mediation)\nThe key concept is an intervention. However, introducing an intervention is often impossible for technical and ethical reasons, and there are so many things to perturb to test the effects. Moreover, the effects of causal mechanisms might be too small to quantify within a reasonable statistical error reliably. How do we ascertain causal effects by intervention?\nStepping back, let us think about two principal axes of the data generation process: the breadth of population-level measurements across tens of thousands of samples and the depth of regulatory genomics across multiple layers of causal mechanisms, seeking a precise answer up to a single-cell resolution.\n{{&lt; figure library=\"true\" src=\"project/cancer_genomics_research.png\" title=\"Integrative cancer research builds on two principal axes of genomics data. (A) Population-level studies investigate variation across large cohorts. (B) Regulatory genomics researches delve into multiple layers of molecular networks.\" &gt;}}\nWe can recognize a causal direction from genetic information to phenotypic variation if we consider that genotypes are shaped by nature’s randomized controlled trial (RCT), or natural interventions. Given that, the goal is to identify causal mediators located in the middle of the above causal diagram. In the context of genome-wide association studies (GWAS), the mediator variables include relevant cell types and target genes derived from tissue-level or cell-type-level eQTL data.\nRemoving unwanted variability by \"control\" data\nMany scientific discoveries are best represented as a set of contrastive statements, such as \"A rather than B\" (Peter Lipton) because such a contrastive explanation clarifies our claim's scope and basis. The validity of causal argument can be empirically justified by triangulation of contrastive arguments (Lipton 1991). Therefore, an essential aspect of our research should focus on finding a suitable set of null hypotheses (non-causal facts) to be contrasted against our theory of interest to uphold. What are non-causal effects that may obfuscate the activity of scientific research? Are they generated uniformly at random? In practice, it is hard to characterize non-causal effects without considering confounding variables, and confounders create unwanted non-zero correlations between cause and effect variables.\nConfounder correction is a causal inference problem. So, we need to ask the question of identifiability, such as, \"How do we know this variable is a confounder?\" or \"What is a legitimate criterion that distinguishes between causal and non-causal effects?\". We could start our journey by asking:\n\n\nAre there any control data on which we can safely claim that there is no causal effect whatsoever?\n\n\nAre they already available/observed? Or, should we construct/estimate them?\n\n\nLike many research problems, control data (or variables) are hidden, yet to be estimated. In the mediation problem, for instance, we need to think about how to characterize confounding variables that relate two mediators (genes, M1 and M0) (A) and the other type of confounders between different phenotypes (B). Unless we adjust these confounding effects, mediation effects are not identifiable by statistical inference. Fortunately, we can construct control data that only include non-genetic correlation structures by exploiting human genetics's nature. Since genetic correlations are confined within each linkage disequilibrium (LD) block, we can defuse putative causal effects by projecting summary statistics onto a different, independent LD block (C). We actively construct control data to identify confounding variables.\n{{&lt; figure library=\"true\" src=\"project/mediation_confounder.png\" title=\"Confounder correction in action.

(C) Joint projection of mediator and phenotype variables makes interventions to remove mediating effect but leave confounding effects.\"&gt;}}\nOn this matter, we are broadly interested in general genomics problems, not just statistical genetics ones.  Although the definition of a confounding variable is problem-specific, we seek to design probabilistic models and ML algorithms that semi-automate the overall process. The methods will indicate a set of putative confounding variables with a level of uncertainty by taking input data and prior knowledge (e.g., known causal and non-causal variables).\nA potential outcome framework for causally-differential expression analysis\nRecently, our interest in Donald Rubin's potential outcome framework grew, and started thinking about a type of causal problems that can be better approached by Rudin's causal model (RCM).\n\"Bayesian\" causal inference for single-cell data analysis\nAs a first step, we revisit commonly-practised bioinformatics problems and reformulate them in RCMs.  The ultimate goal of RCM is to ask and estimate counterfactual questions.  Causality is tied to an action (doing), rather than an observation (seeing), and counterfactual causal inference seeks to take an impossible action and estimate its effects.\nSuppose we want to test the causal statement: A gene expression of Y was changed because of a disease X, i.e., $X \\to Y$ with a directed edge (going beyond $Y \\sim X$). We define $X$ to take 1 or 0 for \"yes\" or \"no\" and the resulting gene expression $Y$ to take a real number. In observational studies, including most high-througput assays, we observe a pair of $X_{i}$ and $Y_{i}$ for an individual $i$; there, the observed $Y_{i}$ value stems from the observed $X_{i}$, either 1 or 0, not both. E.g.,\n$i$XY(0)Y(1)\n10$Y_1$?\n21?$Y_2$\n31?$Y_3$\n40$Y_4$?\n$\\vdots$\n\nIn counterfactual inference, we want to infer the other unobserved and not observable cases. For $X_{i}=1$, we want to know the potential outcome of $Y_{i}$ if we had $X_{i} = 0$, and vice versa. RCMs generally translate the underlying problem as a Bayesian imputation problem, or a matrix completion problem, which contains at least 50% of missing values.  Provided an accurate Bayesian imputation method, we can quantify individual-level causal effects, $Y_{i}(1) - Y_{i}(0)$, as well as average causal effects, $\\mathbb{E}\\left[Y(1) - Y(0)\\right]$. This is truly substantial advancement because we no longer worry about identifiability but focus on a statistical inference problem.\nWell, there is a catch. In traditional omics data analysis, such an imputation problem is pretty challenging unless we have a good understanding of the data-generating process, which is often a black box to us. For one individual, we only have one data point $Y_{i}$ unless we borrow information from related genes. We might have to rely on faithful pretreatment variables $W$ as in a causal path, $W \\to X \\to Y$, and construct propensity scores to reweight observed samples.\nHowever, single-cell data provide a unique opportunity for modelling high-dimensional omics profiles. A clear advantage over bulk data is simply that we have more data points per sample (individual).  Assuming that single-cell profiling's sensitivity will become better each year, it is not too far until we can achieve reliable and accurate Bayesian imputation methods--not only the observed values but also the counterfactual values.\n","id":"https://ypark.github.io/posts/causal-bio-2020/","title":"Causal Inference in Genomics"},"https://ypark.github.io/posts/config-2024/":{"body":"Emacs for Rust with rustic and lsp\nLearning Rust is my personal goal for this year. It is very strict in type checking and memory ownership. So, I needed some help until I could fully grasp its key concepts and syntax. I use Emacs for almost everything, including coding.

Some key concepts are only available in certain languages.\nWhen I was a graduate student, Python was not as popular as they are now. Matlab was the ultimate sweet spot for much-needed speed, ease of programming, powerful visualization, and simulation. It was complete liberation. I no longer needed to deal with layers and layers of inheritance of Java classes. Even silly features like that I can type \"why\" on Matlab's terminal to get a nonsense answer were charm.\nHowever, as soon as I embarked on projects involving graph-based traversal and classical graph algorithms, Matlab was no longer an ideal tool for me. Everything underneath quick and easy API needs to be implemented with C++ codes within a notorious MEX, trying hard to package with well-designed template libraries. I first turned to Python 2.7 and survived many years with it, but I was just not so happy with its indentation rule; often, my codes were barely running (at least, I felt like that). Later, I explored O'CaML to bring back the ultimate joy of functional programming. Back then, I had many versions of the same MCMC algorithm written in multiple languages.\nArguably, being bilingual or polylingual is beneficial in many ways. Also, arguably, learning a new programming language is like an abridged version of learning a new natural language. Learning a new language is perhaps far from mapping one to another language. If I had to think of everything in Korean and translate it into English sentence by sentence and word by word, well, then I would not have taken full advantage of every aspect of learning a new language.\nLikewise, if I had to code up a prototype in R and convert it to C++, then I should seriously consider picking up C++ instead of attempting quick fixes by asking any chatbots. Key concepts like memory management are simply hidden underneath the rug, so-called convenience. If any chatbots do a wonderful job, it would brutally deprive us of any possible true learning opportunities.\nThere is no ultimate programming language, but many modern languages were designed to address diverse computing problems. For an applied scientist, having many things in their tool belts can make a big difference. It could shorten tasks from days to hours or even minutes. Learning awk will be an eye-opening experience if one needs to deal with tens of thousands of lines of compressed text files. However, I would not want to use awk (although I tried once) to transpose row-wise tabular data into column-wise ones. Although I heavily depend on well-designed and fast routines of data.table in R, I would never attempt to implement recursion in R and often get uncomfortable with messy and unsafe parallelization.\nI think my brain has well past the peak age of agility and flexibility. It takes a substantially longer time for me to catch up with a new one. Nevertheless, I still feel some urgency. Language shapes the way I think. In many ways, a programming language is a language of science. It can teach us how to abstract away the underlying computing problems of real-world scientific problems. Some people might do computational thinking with pseudocode, but I do with some language I am currently into. Since different languages have been developed to serve different types of computing problems, it is definitely worth diversifying our thoughts.\n","id":"https://ypark.github.io/posts/learn-new-language/","title":"Why we need to consider learning a new language"},"https://ypark.github.io/posts/lightweight-tools-2020/":{"body":"There are already many tools.\nEver since single-cell technology was introduced to the world, every year, every month, we see more tools. See scRNA-tools, for example. Single-cell data analysis often involves many steps of data processing, quantification, and statistical inference. The technology is imperfect, and each step deserves careful consideration of different types of approaches. We, bioinformaticians, test a different combination of small tools and tailor a pipeline that works best for each project. Perhaps, there is no master algorithm, and the competitions among computational biologists are indeed fierce.\nThe history of genomics repeats itself. For a large part of current single-cell data analysis, we probably see what had happened in RNA-seq, even gene expression microarray analysis. Once we knew how to normalize scRNA-seq data, we would like to know how to test differentially-expressed genes. Then, we would want to build more audacious models, such as gene regulatory networks.  Are there any points that we may contribute from a unique perspective? Can existing tools address all the challenges of single-cell data analysis, e.g., \"eleven grand challenges in single-cell data science\"? I believe not. We know there has always been enough room for innovation and creativity.\nOkay, that sounds meek and quite passive. Why do we dare to jump into the battlefield?  We are not a software-engineering lab, but we can become impatient enough to feel the need for a better tool.  Moreover, we want to understand why and how a certain method works, and when that method doesn't work as expected.\nThe underlying data matrix is sparse, really sparse, but most methods make it dense.\nYes, the data matrix is sparse, but it will easily blow up memory if you fill in all the zeros.  Our first impression was that memory overhead was never an issue for most people. Lots of methods focus on replacing the zeros with some other fractional values. Not undermining the validity of imputation methods, we worried more about the scalability of the strategy.  Can such a strategy work for millions of cells with billions of non-zero elements?  Most methods are tested on a rather small data set, including thousands of cells. If a data matrix is sparse, why not we build a method, taking advantage of the sparsity? What if most zero values did not occur by missingness?  What if droplet scRNA-seq is not zero-inflated?\nWe develop a scalable approach to index millions of cells for fast random access.\nWe like to work on a sparse data matrix formatted as a list of triplets, and compressed by gzip or bgzip. The rows correspond to features/genes; the columns correspond to UMI barcodes/cells. We assume the triplets (row, column, value) are sorted by the columns (cells) in ascending order. To mark the line where the columns change, we modify the indexing scheme of TABIX and create a separate .index file to store all the random access points.\nWe implement commonly-used matrix operations to manipulate data more swiftly. In some cases, it is worthwhile to re-implement low-level functions, since we may not need all the steps implemented in a general-purpose library.  We were just too impatient to wait a long I/O time until we finish reading a full 10x matrix (.mtx.gz) using either scipy.io.mmread in Python, or Matrix::readMM in R. As the size of the 10x matrix increase more and more, we also discovered there is a numerical limit for R's Matrix::readMM (less than two billions non-zero elements) and had to face a similar issue in a low-memory machine, such as a modest 8Gb laptop. So, we did the dirty job of C++ implementation. Combined with the indexing scheme, now we can efficiently take a subset of a large matrix stored in a file, not worrying about memory capacity, minimizing the overhead of character parsing and I/O.\nWe want to focus on integrative data analysis across multiple data types and modalities\nWith these tools, including the ones under development, we want to do science. We want others to do science using our tools. We will continuously update a bit more complicated routines for convenience, including cell type annotation, data aggregation, cell type deconvolution, batch-balancing k-nearest neighborhood, etc.\n","id":"https://ypark.github.io/posts/lightweight-tools-2020/","title":"Lightweight tools for integrative single-cell data analysis"},"https://ypark.github.io/posts/llm-vs-human/":{"body":"I've randomly stumbled upon this article, Large language models surpass human experts in predicting neuroscience results.

For this purpose, we make use of principal curves to draw a path through the gene expression space of each lineage\n\n\n\nProject all data points onto the curve and calculate the arc length from the beginning of the curve to each point’s projection. Setting the lowest value to zero, this produces pseudotimes.\n\n\nFor each dimension $j$, $j \\in {1,…,J'}$, use the cells' pseudotimes to predict their coordinates, typically with a smoothing spline. This produces a set of J' functions which collectively map pseudotime values, thereby defining a smooth curve in J' dimensions.\n\n\nRepeat this process until convergence.

We develop Bayesian machine learning methods that excavate a latent structure or underlying joint models of summary statistics data.\n\nWhat are summary statistics data?\nThere is no clear boundary to define that data are made available at the summary or observation level.  Suppose the size of a data matrix/tensor $Z$ is smaller than the underlying sample size (number of observations). Each element in the data matrix $Z$ is generated as a result of some transformation of raw data. In that case, we often consider that the data $Z$ is observed at the summary level.  Summary statistics data could be first and second-order moments (mean and variance), p-values, z-scores, effect sizes, and standard errors, etc. As the most well-known summary statistics data, we could think of the results of genome-wide association studies (GWAS).\nWhy do we bother summary statistics?\nThe foremost reason is that people feel pretty comfortable with sharing summary statistics. Unlike we have to deal with strict regulations to access individual-level data, a user (researcher) may find easily-downloadable GWAS summary statistics vectors from a public database. For the other party, those who provide data, there is almost no need to anonymize it since each data point does not correspond to an individual. For most clinical and public health studies, research groups share their final results as a giant summary statistics table. Other researchers gain essential knowledge by using them in subsequent research.\nGreat, but it sounds like everything is done and remains nothing to be done. I just said that summary statistics data are often final to some studies. Yes, to some people, but not to those who care about a generative model involving lots of parameters. Most summary data only investigate relationships between one variable with the other variable, but not many to many. Only a set of marginal probabilities, but not the joint probability of all. Can we recover a joint, multivariate model from a set of univariate models? Taking it further, can we estimate a joint probability of multiple studies conducted independently by different groups by combining summary data collected from each of them?\nSummary-based regression modelling\nZhu and Stephens (2017) PMID: 29399241 proposed an interesting idea, termed regression with summary statistics (RSS) model.  RSS recovers the high-dimensional parameters of a multivariate (linear) regression model, highlighting a correspondence between the multivariate and univariate association statistics.\nWe also found the RSS type of modelling can be effective enough to capture causal SNPs in high-dimensional variable selection problems. Here, we show simulation results on the reference panel genotype matrix (the 1000 genomes project; on chromosome 1, European samples, n=503).

However, I did not find an easy explanation (at least to me) on why and how it works.\n1. How should we \"embed\" (locate) genes (words)? And why do we need embedding?\nEmbedding is like mapping a gene expression value in some latent space well spread between the values. In other words, from a point in the embedding space, we can recover each gene's name and its expression value (or ranking). It's important to understand what the embedding of a gene onto $d$-dimensional space does. Since my mindset has been stuck in a matrix factorization-like model for many years, I find this embedding step quite counter-intuitive. My other complaint is that \"embedding\" is not a good terminology at all. I think the whole step is more closely related to \"stochastic\" registration, dictionary, etc (just my complaint).\nA document (or cell) as a bag of words\nWhile not doing explicit embedding, in a typical fully connected neural network layer, we mark (or implicitly embed) a gene to a unique index (a variable or a visible unit). However, gene expression counts are not uniquely handled. In other words, the same gene can be \"replicated\" as if we keep on adding its contribution to the next hidden layer. The underlying concept seems very similar to Replicated Softmax: an Undirected Topic Model.\nIf we have a softmax model that maps for each word $d=1,\\ldots,D$, we would have the energy function (to be minimized):\n$$E = -\\sum_{d=1}^{D} \\sum_{g} \\sum_{k} W_{gk}^{(d)} v_{g}^{(d)} h_{k}$$\nwhere we denote $g$ for a gene $g$ and $k$ for a factor/topic $k$; $v_{g}^{(d)} = 1$ if and only if a gene $g$ is present in a document $d$; each word $d$'s model have weights $W_{gk}^{(d)}$ between a topic $k$ and gene $g$.\nAssuming all the models share the same weights, namely $W_{gk}^{(d)}=W_{gk}, \\forall d \\in [D]$, and $x_{g}$ counts the frequency of a gene $g$ across all the words in this document, we can simplify:\n$$E = -\\sum_{g} \\sum_{k} W_{gk} x_{g} h_{k}$$\nThis makes sense if we take each document as \"a bag of words,\" where each gene is independently drawn within a document, conditioning on the topic proportion and latent topic membership of the word.\nWhat have we missed with the bag-of-words assumption?\nSince bag-of-words models have been so successful for many years and seem good enough for single-cell modelling, it is hard to justify why we would need a more sophisticated language model. So, this is not an exhaustive survey on what the bag-of-words missed:\n\n\nMonotone contribution: We cannot map gene (word) counts in a non-linear fashion, meaning that a higher count of a gene $g$ will always have more weight on the same gene $g$ toward the next layer, i.e., $W_{gk}$ will increase for a particular $h_{k}$. In NLP, double or triple negation expressions are difficult to understand with a bag-of-words model. If a certain housekeeping gene (ribosomal or mitochondrial) is just highly expressed, its influence will dominate and mask out subtle yet significant context-dependent changes.\n\n\nLack of dependency within a layer: We need many layers to represent word-to-word non-linear relationships. A single layer of the softmax model cannot represent ordering or any sort of positional information across words. Using a softmax function or similar can have some effect of \"lateral inhibition\"-like mechanisms so that a sparse set of keywords can be selected for each topic. However, it can also make known or unknown stopwords appear across multiple topics without apparent meaning. There is no direct influence across topics that having some high-frequency word in one topic prevents the other topic from picking up the same words, except for some statistical pressure.\n\n\nGene embedding is like word embedding in NLP\nAn embedding can bring more flexibility on interpreting the number of the same word (gene) occurred within a document (cell).\nFirst of all, what is \"word embedding?\" In PyTorch's documentation for Embedding class, it says:\n\nInput: (*), IntTensor or LongTensor of arbitrary shape containing the indices to extract and\nOutput: (*,H), where * is the input shape and H = embedding_dim\n\nFor scGPT, this embedding class is directly applied to integer-valued expression tensor.\nIn a nutshell, each cell is like a fixed length (number of words/tokens) document (or sentence) with tokens (genes). Discretized/binned gene expression levels on each gene (word) uniquely mapped onto some $d$-dimensional latent space. For instance, $x_{g}=1$ and $x_{g}=10$ are independently located apart from each other in some embedding space. Upon training, we may be able to tell whether $x_{g}=1$ and $x_{g}=10$ mean semantically similar but very different from $x_{g}=5$. A gene embedding step clearly brings non-monotone expressivity in a language model. Anecdotally, \"not\" and \"not, not, not\" can be located in nearby locations apart from \"not, not\" if that's easier to picture. We do not specify their positions but learn semantic similarity from examples.\nOkay, what about gene/word identity? Many single-cell foundation models include a positional embedding. If only the highly variable/expressed genes were considered, and subsequent gene-by-gene attention modules could have been mapped out in GPU memory, we wouldn't need to consider this. As long as we can feed genes in the same order, we are uniquely mapping gene symbols onto identity space. A token of the g-th position is always the same gene. Positional embedding would have been redundant. However, if the length of accessible genes from one cell to another greatly varies, and padding unexpressed genes/words with zeros is highly inefficient, we need to think of a cell as a series of tokens, just like a sentence of words dynamically rearranged. Here, a token $\\neq$ a word.\n2. What attention mechanisms can do with gene embedding vectors?\nNow, let's discuss the elephant in the room: What in the world is attention? Why is attention all you need? First, we need to know what else has been considered so essential in previous work besides attention mechanisms. In NLP, a sentence of words has been modelled as a sequence of hidden states, such as recurrent neural network (RNN) models. One of the most recent RNN architectures is Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), where the layer keeps the memory of previous words' hidden states to figure out the state of a current word. Since \"memory\" is not a part of the model parameters, it is somehow wasted, computationally cumbersome and not ideal for dealing with long sentences.\nHow can we represent a sentence of words in a meaningful way?\nOkay. We need to model word-to-word dependency structures without inferring what each word's state could be. Why did we want to assign some latent states to words in a sentence? From the perspective of a hidden Markov model (a grandfather of a language model), knowing previous states, we can identify blocks of consecutive words, and then we can aggregate information within each block without too much loss of information. Keeping memory in the model is useful to parse out the meaning of a sentence. It might be an effective way to explain what the meaning of an overall sentence would be for a non-native English reader/writer, segmenting a sentence into multiple blocks (clauses), and so on. At the same time, such a pedagogy could become an obstacle when students want to generate a new sentence by themselves.\nAn attention mechanism simplifies this sentence-generating process.\nIt is like the way a baby learns a new language to me. A stream of words comes as a sentence. The first word will be understood together with other words that arrive later in the same sentence. It might be the imminent one or much later. As a neural model accumulates examples of sentences, associating the first word with others, the second with others, and so on, we can follow the probability of such word-to-word associations. Provided that the order of genes within a cell sentence/document is fixed, we can keep track of how frequently genes are jointly associated (or disassociated). For each gene, we can fit a softmax function (probability) to learn about frequent \"neighbours\" in the embedded space. Well, very roughly. For this type of process, there is no memory of word-specific states. In other words, if we consider a single cell as a scene of a movie or play, we don't need to know whether a gene plays an antagonist or protagonist in the scene. We just need to know who else appears here and how they interact with one another.\nHashing, dictionary, and (query, key, and value)\nInteractions between genes matter, and keeping track of interactions is our only interest. For simplicity, although we don't need to do so, let's assume that gene embedding coordinates are fixed.\n\nWe need to bring two genes closer if they talk to each other more frequently than others. Borrowing the concept of locality sensitive hashing, we use a query of one gene to locate neighbouring genes according to their key in the embedding space. For closer gene pairs key and query should be similar, while distant pairs have largely independent key and query patterns. We could revise the embedding coordinates directly based on semantic similarity scores. However, if we want to stack up this gene-to-gene matching process within many different contexts, defining additional transformation functions for key and query vectors can render a more general modelling capability. More specifically, for the embedding vector of a gene $g_{1}$, namely $x_{g_{1}}$, and other $g_{2}$, namely $x_{g_{2}}$, we transform them into $[Q_{g_{1}1}, \\ldots, Q_{g_{1}d}]$ and $[K_{g_{2}1},\\ldots,K_{g_{2}d}]$, $d$-vectors. Then, we test how well the query and key vectors agree with each other by taking the dot product; this proximity information can be scaled and converted to a probably by the softmax transformation.\n$$\\textsf{Attention}(Q,K,V) = \\underbrace{ \\textsf{softmax}\\left( \\frac{QK^{\\top}}{\\sqrt{d}} \\right) }_{\\color{blue}\\textsf{proximity between genes}} V.$$\nThe value vectors, $V$, map how each gene can work. Roughly, we may think of a traditional fully connected neural network layer as a diagonal attention matrix and only the V matrix. There, we encode gene expression patterns into some hidden codes. Putting them all together, in terms of the scene analogy, genes act on some value $V$ here, while interacting with their partners and influencing one another. In the next scene, we see the consolidated net effects of the entire scene.  Sure, we may rule out some genes/actors in the current scene as they fit in the story. Moreover, instead of considering all pairwise interactions, we may restrict/focus on feasible interactions, potentially set by physical constraints, such as protein-protein interactions and cellular locations.\n3. Can attention-based models be foundational for single-cell RNA-seq modelling?\nI think gene embedding is a good idea. Well, I also like the way we represent gene-gene interactions as a stack of attention layers. But could we derive a foundational model? For a model to be foundational, well, what features, characteristics, or properties should a model possess and demonstrate? Very roughly... If we roughly consider each transformer layer modelled by attention networks as a scene or a set of rules for generating a scene, we may be able to run a realistic show with fifty of them stacked together, so is true with diffusion-based models. Well, is it foundational? We may need to define what the \"foundation\" model exactly means, though. I will leave all these sorts of questions for other posts.\n","id":"https://ypark.github.io/posts/transformer-attention-network/","title":"Embedding, attention, and transformers"},"https://ypark.github.io/posts/transparent-parameterization/":{"body":"TL;DR: Consider transparent parameterization for a partially identified model if a strong dependency with prior distributions was found in Bayesian causal inference.\n\nTransparent Parametrizations of Models for Potential Outcomes\n\nSet-up:\n\n$Z \\in {0,1}$: a randomized assignment or \"instrument\"; $Z$ is a treatment, presumed to be randomized, e.g., the assigned treatment.\n$X \\in {0,1}$: an exposure measure; $X$ is an exposure subsequent to treatment assignment.\n$Y \\in {0,1}$: a final response; $Y$ is the response.\nThere might be confounding on $X$ and $Y$\n\nGoal: What is the effect of $X$ on $Y$?\nIdentifiability matters, so we should make which parts are identifiable and which parts not.\n\nIt is often argued that identifiability is of secondary importance\nin a Bayesian analysis provided that the prior and likelihood lead\nto a proper joint posterior for all the parameters in the model.\n[...] we argue that partially identified models should be\nre-parameterized so that the complete parameter vector may be\ndivided into point-identified and entirely non-identified\nsubvectors.
