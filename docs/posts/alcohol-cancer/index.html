    <section class="body">
      <p>Perhaps based on <a href="https://www.ajpmonline.org/article/S0749-3797(23)00501-9/fulltext">this prospective study</a> and many other articles, the US Surgeon General identified heavy alcohol consumption as <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/surgeongeneral/priorities/alcohol-cancer/index.html">a potential cause of many cancers</a>. There are several biological mechanisms. See <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/oash-alcohol-cancer-fig4.jpg">Four ways alcohol can cause cancer</a>.</p>
<p>All of them remind me of cancer biology courses I took a decade ago. I agree alcohol can cause cancer in some ways, but proving the causality and measuring causal effect sizes will probably be another research question. Showing tobacco causes cancer took nearly a half-century from the earliest wakeup calls until the US Surgeon General finally acknowledged the fact, and perhaps longer until the tobacco companies took meaningful action.</p>
<p>I am wondering if there are any (genetic) instrumental variables to establish some sense of causality. Well... In fact, there are some:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.ade2780">Genetic architecture of alcohol consumption identified by a genotype-stratified GWAS and impact on esophageal cancer risk in Japanese people</a></p>
<ul>
<li>No wonder several alcohol intake GWAS variants are located in biochemically-relevant genes, including <em>ALDH1B</em> and <em>ALDH2</em>; they are also "colocalized" in interaction analysis with cancer GWAS studies.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://aacrjournals.org/cebp/article/31/5/1077/694750/Beyond-GWAS-of-Colorectal-Cancer-Evidence-of">Beyond GWAS of Colorectal Cancer: Evidence of Interaction with Alcohol Consumption and Putative Causal Variant for the 10q24.2 Region</a></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>"Another possibility is that light-to-moderate drinking has a protective effect on risk of colorectal cancer, even though heavier consumption is detrimental."</em> This clearly sets their questions and why they designed the study to show in which direction effects could go.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Also, G x E interaction analysis with stratification--non-drinking, light-drinking, and heavy-drinking. We see some significant hits (why?), and they end up with somewhat bizarre conclusion: <em>"Our study suggests that the association with colorectal cancer in 10q24.2/COX15 observed in genome-wide association study is strongest in nondrinkers."</em> What about the other variants?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What if drinking behaviour is a mediator variable (genetic variant to drinking to cancer)? The stratification step could create artificial associations between genetic variants and cancer phenotypes.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-53926-z">The causal effects of genetically predicted alcohol consumption on endometrial cancer risk from a Mendelian randomization study</a></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Summary-based MR analysis.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Also, a bit weird conclusion: <em>"This MR study suggests that genetically predicted alcohol consumption is a protective factor for EC, particularly for EEC, and this protective effect may be mediated through the reduction of HCG and IGF1."</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What if people abstained from drinking because of health concerns, such as a family history of endometrial cancer? IV assumptions would be easily invalid. EC GWAS is also sampled from the same UK Biobank cohorts, which could put the study design in a precarious position.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Okay, I may want to believe that alcohol is a cause of cancer. But I don't think we have a definitive answer to the underlying causal questions. Studies often disagree with each other. It's like opening up another decade of debate among researchers, policymakers, and the general public. However, I don't think we are missing a chance to potential protective effects of alcohol by not cutting down on drinking. A more constructive way forward will be looping in molecular mechanisms in causal inference exercises. We identified the mechanisms in laboratory settings. How does it work at a population level? Are there alcohol-interaction molecular QTL studies? Shouldn't we consider gene-gene interactions and compensatory mechanisms? Lots of "could've done" items.</p>
