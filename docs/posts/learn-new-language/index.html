            <p><em>TL;DR</em>: Consider learning a new programming language. Some key concepts are only available in certain languages.</p>
<p>When I was a graduate student, <code>Python</code> was not as popular as they are now. Matlab was the ultimate sweet spot for much-needed speed, ease of programming, powerful visualization, and simulation. It was complete liberation. I no longer needed to deal with layers and layers of inheritance of Java classes. Even silly features like that I can type "why" on Matlab's terminal to get a nonsense answer were charm.</p>
<p>However, as soon as I embarked on projects involving graph-based traversal and classical graph algorithms, Matlab was no longer an ideal tool for me. Everything underneath quick and easy API needs to be implemented with <code>C++</code> codes within a notorious <code>MEX</code>, trying hard to package with well-designed template libraries. I first turned to <code>Python 2.7</code> and survived many years with it, but I was just not so happy with its indentation rule; often, my codes were barely running (at least, I felt like that). Later, I explored <code>O'CaML</code> to bring back the ultimate joy of functional programming. Back then, I had many versions of the same MCMC algorithm written in multiple languages.</p>
<p>Arguably, being bilingual or polylingual is beneficial in many ways. Also, arguably, learning a new programming language is like an abridged version of learning a new natural language. Learning a new language is perhaps far from mapping one to another language. If I had to think of everything in Korean and translate it into English sentence by sentence and word by word, well, then I would not have taken full advantage of every aspect of learning a new language.</p>
<p>Likewise, if I had to code up a prototype in <code>R</code> and convert it to <code>C++</code>, then I should seriously consider picking up <code>C++</code> instead of attempting quick fixes by asking any chatbots. Key concepts like memory management are simply hidden underneath the rug, so-called convenience. If any chatbots do a wonderful job, it would brutally deprive us of any possible true learning opportunities.</p>
<p>There is no ultimate programming language, but many modern languages were designed to address diverse computing problems. For an applied scientist, having many things in their tool belts can make a big difference. It could shorten tasks from days to hours or even minutes. Learning <code>awk</code> will be an eye-opening experience if one needs to deal with tens of thousands of lines of compressed text files. However, I would not want to use <code>awk</code> (although I tried once) to transpose row-wise tabular data into column-wise ones. Although I heavily depend on well-designed and fast routines of <code>data.table</code> in <code>R</code>, I would never attempt to implement recursion in <code>R</code> and often get uncomfortable with messy and unsafe parallelization.</p>
<p>I think my brain has well past the peak age of agility and flexibility. It takes a substantially longer time for me to catch up with a new one. Nevertheless, I still feel some urgency. Language shapes the way I think. In many ways, a programming language is a language of science. It can teach us how to abstract away the underlying computing problems of real-world scientific problems. Some people might do computational thinking with pseudocode, but I do with some language I am currently into. Since different languages have been developed to serve different types of computing problems, it is definitely worth diversifying our thoughts.</p>
